# Station Vitamine Data Analysis Project

## üìã Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing sales, waste, and vendor data for Station Vitamine, a juice store. The goal is to improve inventory management, reduce waste, and evaluate vendor performance to optimize operations. The project uses Python to process data, generate insights, and create visualizations.

### Objectives:
- Achieve a **15% reduction in excess inventory** by analyzing daily sales data and adjusting stock levels.
- Minimize juice waste by **20%**, as measured by weekly reports, by recommending loss reduction strategies.
- Evaluate vendor performance based on quality, cost, and delivery time for ingredient procurement.
- Identify top-selling products and busiest operational hours.

# Comprehensive Project Conclusion for Station Vitamine

## Objective 1: Reduce Excess Inventory and Improve Stock Management

### Key Findings:
- **Sales vs. Waste by Product**: Products like *Super Cup*, *Vitamin C*, and *Vita Pro* consistently sell well, showing high demand and lower relative waste.
- Products like *Peanut Cacao Smoothie* and *Smoothie Tr√®s Baies* have higher waste proportions compared to sales, suggesting overproduction or low demand.

### Recommendations:
1. Maintain stock levels of at least **20 units per day** for top-selling products like *Vitamin C* and *Super Cup* to meet consistent demand.
2. Reduce daily stock levels for slower-moving products, such as *Peanut Cacao Smoothie*, to align production with demand trends and minimize waste.
3. Implement **demand forecasting** using historical trends to dynamically adjust inventory.

---

## Objective 2: Minimize Juice Waste

### Key Findings:
- **Total Weekly Waste (All Products)**: Waste trends stabilize mid-week and decrease towards the weekend, indicating inefficiencies in weekday production planning.
- **Weekly Waste Trends by Product**: Consistent waste levels were noted for items like *Smoothie Mango* and *Energy Plus+*.

### Recommendations:
1. Optimize production schedules by creating **smaller batches mid-week** and increasing production for peak days like Friday and Saturday.
2. Introduce **promotional offers** or discounts for slow-moving products nearing expiration to reduce waste.
3. Regularly analyze waste trends and **adjust production plans weekly**.

---

## Objective 3: Evaluate Vendor Performance

### Key Findings:
- **Comparison of Vendor Scores Across Criteria**: *Vendor 3* emerged as the best option, excelling in cost, delivery time, and quality.
- **Comparison of Vendor Scores Across Products**: *Vendor 3* consistently scored highly across multiple products.

### Recommendations:
1. Select *Vendor 3* as the **primary supplier** for most ingredients due to lower delivery costs and reliable quality.
2. Use *Vendor 2* selectively for **premium products** requiring higher quality standards.
3. Establish **regular reviews** with vendors to maintain consistent service and proactively address issues.

---

## Objective 4: Identify Top-Selling Products and Busiest Operational Hours

### Key Findings:
- **Total Orders by Product Name**: *Vitamin C*, *Vita Pro*, and *Super Cup* are the top-selling products, consistently outperforming others.
- Analysis of purchase timings indicates **peak operational hours** during lunchtime (11 AM‚Äì2 PM).

### Recommendations:
1. Ensure **higher stock levels** for top-performing products during peak hours.
2. Strategically staff and promote during **lunch hours** to maximize sales.
3. Consider **bundling top-selling products** with slower-moving ones to increase overall sales.

## Overall Business Impact

This analysis provides actionable insights to:
- Optimize inventory management by aligning stock levels with demand trends.
- Minimize waste through targeted production and promotional strategies.
- Leverage vendor performance evaluations to streamline procurement processes.
- Focus operational resources on high-demand products and peak hours to improve profitability.

### Future Steps:
1. Automate inventory tracking with **real-time dashboards**.
2. Develop **predictive models** for sales and waste trends to improve planning accuracy.
3. Collect and integrate **customer feedback data** to refine product offerings and pricing strategies.


### üìù Notes:
